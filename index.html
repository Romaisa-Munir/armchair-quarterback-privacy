            <li> Record finish times of runners</li>
            <li> No photos or videos are stored permanently</li>
            <li> Camera feed is processed in real-time for timing purposes only</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>We collect only:
        <ul>
            <li> Race timing data</li>
            <li> Runner finish times</li>
            <li> No personal identification information is collected through the camera</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
