        - Record finish times of runners
        - No photos or videos are stored permanently
        - Camera feed is processed in real-time for timing purposes only</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>We collect only:
        - Race timing data
        - Runner finish times
        - No personal identification information is collected through the camera</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All timing data is stored locally on your device. We do not upload or share camera feeds or images.</p>
